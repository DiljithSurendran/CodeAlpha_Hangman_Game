As part of my Python Programming internship at CodeAlpha,

Task_1
my first task included the following instructions:
"Design a text-based Hangman game. The program selects a random word, and the player guesses one letter at a time to uncover the word. You can set a limit on the number of incorrect guesses allowed."

The file "HangmanGame_Diljith.py" demonstrates how I achieved that.

Task_2
My Second task included the following instructions:
A basic text-based chatbot that can have conversations with users, using natural language processing libraries like NLTK to make the chatbot more conversational
The file "Chatbot.py" demonstrates how I achieved that.

Task_3
My Third task included the following instructions:
Stock PortfolioTracker -Create a stock portfolio tracking tool that allows users to add, remove, and track the performance of their stock investments. Utilize financial APIs for real-time stock data.
The file "Stockportfoiliotracker.py" demonstrates how I achieved that.
